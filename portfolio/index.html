              <h2>Image Organizer Web Application</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p> This web application allows users to upload images to their personal gallery and add tags to each image which can be used to filter the gallery to display only images tagged with a particular term.  This is a <b>personal project</b> that I undertook to demonstrate my knowledge and abilities in creating web applications with <b>Python Flask</b> and other web development technologies. Through developing this project I have expanded my knowledge of Python Flask and learnt new techniques and skills that I can use in future projects such as session management and restricting access to resources. Although the user interface is relatively simple, the application shows that I have a solid understanding of developing applications with Python Flask. The application resizes well (albeit with some elements being a little large) which means that it is usable on mobile devices.
              </p>
              <h4>The video below showcases the main features of the application:</h4>

              </div>
              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>
              As previously mentioned, the application uses the <b>Python Flask</b> web framework to host the application.<br><br>
              Other technologies that are used are:
              </p>
              <ul style="text-align:left">
                <li>A <b>SQLite</b> database with a table to store users' log-in details (with passwords only stored in a hashed + salted form), a table to store the paths to the images and owners of each image and a table to store tags for the images.</li>
                <li><b>CSS3</b> is for the styling of the elements on each page.</li>
                <li><b>JavaScript</b> is used to display and control elements on pages - for instance to correctly display the boxes to delete images or tags (with the buttons performing the correct functions).</li>
                <li><b>Bootstrap</b> is used throughout the application for certain buttons, containers and forms. This increases the compatibility with mobile devices as it increases the likelyhood that elements with be resized correctly.</li>
                <li>The <b>Python</b> module <b>Pillow</b> is used to create thumbnails of the uploaded images which are displayed in the gallery to drastically reduce the loading time of the gallery.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This project is still <b>in development</b> and there are some known security flaws - including the fact that a secure connection (via HTTPS) is not established with passwords being sent as plain text. The application is also vulnerable to session hijacking.<br><br>
                To run the project, some modules may need to be installed. (such as <b>Flask</b> and <b>Pillow</b>)

              <h2>Realtime Image Sharing + Viewing Application</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p> This program allows users to send and receive images with a group over the internet and also view them in real-time together (i.e. when one user changes to an image, all other users will also quickly change to the same image). This allows you to send and discuss images with a group at the same time with all users having the ability to control what image is being shown on screen. This is a <b>personal project</b> I have undertaken to solve a problem that my friends and I often have when trying to discuss images for a project at the same time.
              </p>
              <h4>The video below shows the application being used by two clients - both sending and receiving images and switching between the different images:</h4>

                </video>
              </div>
              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>
              The application is written in <b>Java</b> and uses <b>JavaFX</b> for the GUI. To send and receive data between the clients, the application uses the publicly available Eclipse IoT MQTT server (<a href="http://iot.eclipse.org/">iot.eclipse.org</a>) as a third party. This uses the publish/subscribe pattern where all client subscribed to a topic will receive all messages published to that topic. The third-party server is being used to avoid the need for VPNs or other solutions such as port-forwarding - it also means that each client does not need to know the IP address of the other clients in order to send/receive data with them.<br><br>
              As all messages published to this server are public, I have implemented <b>symmetric encryption</b> for all messages (messages are encrypted by the sender and decrypted by all the recipients). Currently, the key is fixed and hard coded into the program which is not very secure as every single message sent by the program can be decrypted using the same key. I plan to remedy this by establishing a new symmetric key at the start of every session (and also establish new keys after some time has passed). To securely send this key to other users in the session I plan to make the program first generate a public/private key pair. The public key can then be sent to the user who has generated the new symettric key. They can then encrypt the symmetric key (with the other users public key) and send this back to the them.<br><br>
              This project is still <b>in development</b> and as such there are many known issues and bugs with the program which I plan to fix soon.

              <h2>Music Bingo Game Generator</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p>Music Bingo is the variation on normal bingo where the numbers are replaced with songs which the players must listen out for. This program allows users to generate their own games of Music Bingo using their own music clips. This is a <b>personal project</b> I wanted to make as there are some interesting problems which need to be solved - including ensuring all tickets are unique, generating PDFs, editing and generating MP3 files, reading and processing ID3 tags and other game issues such as ensuring the game is exciting (by making the win as late as possible), and ensuring only one winner.<br><br>
              Before generating any bingo games the user must first get many song clips (around 10-15 seconds) and label them with the correct ID3 tags (Title and Artist) for that clip. These clips must then be placed in the Clips folder. When the user opens the program, the list on the left will show all the possible songs they have to choose from (with the titles and artists being read from each file's ID3 tags). The user can then select as many songs as they want to be in the game they are generating (a good number is around 45 songs - which typically generates around a 10 minute game). Once the tracks have been chosen, the user must specify the amount of tickets they want to generate in the text entry box in the bottom left of the program and then click the generate game button.<br><br>After a short wait, a folder will open with all the generated files (as shown below). In the folder there is a PDF file of all the bingo tickets that have been generated (example page shown below). There will also be a generated MP3 file which has all the selected tracks edited into a random order with a 'swoosh' sound effect transition between each clip and a 5 second countdown at the start (due to copyright restrictions, an example of a generated MP3 cannot be made available here). To accompany the MP3 there will also be another PDF file which will show the order of when each of the tracks is played on the generated MP3 (example shown below) - this allows whoever is running the game to keep track of the current point in the game.
              </p>
              <h4>The image below shows the three files automatically generated by the program:</h4>

              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>This project was written in <b>Python 3</b> and uses <b>Tkinter</b> for the GUI. To ensure that all the bingo tickets are unique, each of the selected songs is assigned a prime number before generating the tickets. When a ticket (of 15 randomly selected songs) is generated, all of the prime numbers associated with the selected tracks are multiplied together and stored in a list of used ticket numbers. If a generated ticket number is already in the list of used tickets, the ticket must be a duplicate (and is therefore discarded) as the only possible way to generate the ticket number by multiplying prime numbers is by using the exact same numbers (and therefore songs).<br><br>
              To generate the MP3 file, the program reads in all the clips with <b>FFMPEG</b> and combines them together (with a transition sound effect between each clip) in the random order generated prior to generating the MP3. To ensure that there are no jarring differences in volume levels between clips, they are all normalized to the same volume prior to adding them to the generated track. Once all the clips have been combined, the new MP3 is exported using <b>FFMPEG</b> and labelled with the correct game ID number.<br><br>
              The python library ‘<b>reportlab</b>’ is used to generate the PDFs of the bingo tickets and track listing.<br><br>
              Along with the PDFs, two text files are also produced. One file simply maps the ticket number to the number generated by multiplying the primes associated with all the tracks on that ticket - this is a simple way of storing all the tracks on a ticket without listing all of them. The other text file lists all the tracks in the game in order of their occurrence in the game along with the prime number associated with that song.
              Both of these files allow a separate <b>ticket checker</b> program I wrote to work (shown below). This asks you to input the game number, and ticket number and it will tell you when that ticket will win. This means that the person running the game does not need to check every single song on the ticket in order to check if it has won - therefore potentially saving a lot of time. </p>
              <h4>The Ticket Checker:</h4>
              <div class="imageContainer" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:0px;">
                <div class="individualImageContainer" style="width: 362px; height: 246px;"><img src="./images/bingo/ticketChecker.jpg" height="246" width="362"></div>
              </div>
              <p>In order to make the game more exciting and ensure one winner the ticket generation is not truly random. Instead the tickets are generated to ensure that all but 4 of the tickets have at least one of the last 4 songs on them. This essentially means that they will not win (but this will only be clear if the order of the songs is known). The remaining 4 tickets will win on one of each of the 4 songs that occur before the final 4. These 4 'winning tickets' are spread evenly throughout the pack of tickets - this ensures that if at least the first 25% of the tickets are sold, there will be only be one winner (which will not necessarily be in the first 25% if more than 25% are sold).</p>

              <h2>Controllable OpenGL Particle System</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p>This project was part of my Advanced Computer Graphics course in the first semester of my third year at University. We were tasked with creating a particle system which could be controlled and adjusted in realtime. The program I have created allows you to control many parameters including start and end colours, particle lifetime, particle birthrate, velocity, gravity strength, particle style (rendered as points, squares or stars), particle size, the spread of the particles and explosions (on death) and particle trails. I also implemented a dedicated 'fireworks mode' which can be seen in the middle GIF below.</p>
              <h4>Some examples of what can be produced with this system are shown below:</h4>
              <div class="imageContainer">
                <div class="individualImageContainer" style="width: 304px; height: 244px;"><img src="./images/particles/particles1.gif" height="244" width="304"></div>

              </div>
              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>This project was written in <b>C</b> using <b>OpenGL</b> and <b>GLUT</b> for the rendering of the world and particle system. All the information about the individual particles was stored a in <b>struct</b> called Particle. To allow for the easy addition and removal of particles to the system, each Particle <b>struct</b> contained pointers to both the previous and next particles - creating a <b>doubly linked list</b> of particles.<br><br>
                When the particles hit the ground plane, they bounce off at a dampened velocity, dictated by a parameter in the program. This is acheived by checking (at every tick) whether the particle will go below the ground level in the current tick (by comparing the y co-ordinate of the plane with the y co-ordinate + velocity of the particle), if the particle will go below, the y co-ordinate is set to be equal to the ground plane and the y velocity is reversed and scaled down.<br><br>
                To create the particle trails, after each tick, the particle emits another smaller particle behind it which has a very short life - when in motion, this gives the effect of a trail behind the particle with the same shape as the particle.<br>
                Explosions are created in a similar way, where on death, several particles with short lives are emitted from the point of death in every direction, this creates an explosion effect on the death of a particle.</p>

              <h2>Train Station Live Departure Board</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p>This program is a full screen live train station departure board which could potentially be displayed on screens in venues close to train stations (such as pubs and restaurants). This would give customers a realtime view of the station departures, giving them an easy way to see when their next train is and decide when to leave. As you can see in the image below, any alterations (such as delays and bus replacements) to the scheduled service are shown in different colours, this makes the alteration clear to the customers. In addition to the departure board, the program will periodically alternate to display advertising screens at a pre-defined interval. This will allow the venue to also use the screen to display any promotions they may wish to show to customers in addition to the train times. This was a <b>personal project</b> that I created as I wanted to try building an automatically updating display which used live data taken from an external source.</p>

              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>This project was written <b>Python 3</b>, using <b>Tkinter</b> for the display. The live train station departure data is accessed using the <b>National Rail's Darwin SOAP API</b> (<a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/100296.aspx">found here</a>). This API allows you to easily retrieve data from any train station run by National Rail - including live arrival and departure boards. To use the Darwin API, one must first sign up for the service and be assigned a unique API key. In my program, I am using a python library (<b>nredarwin</b>) to handle the communications with the server (such as the construction of the messages sent to the server). To keep the data up-to-date, the data is refreshed every 45 seconds. As Tkinter supports PNGs natively, the advertising screens must be in a PNG format to work. The resolution of the advertising screens should match the resolution of the display.</p>

              <h2>Website Development Projects</h2>
              <h3>Supernova Visuals Website</h3>
              <p>In 2015, I started developing a website for a friend to showcase his visual effects projects and host tutorials and VFX resources. Sadly the website was never completed as it was no longer required due to certain circumstances. Before the project was cancelled, there were a few pages that were completed. One of these pages is a portfolio page, a copy of which can be <b><a href="./supernova-visuals/portfolio/incursion" target="_blank">found here</a></b> (many links will lead nowhere). Another page that was completed was the 'Contact' page which can be seen below. This page allowed visitors to send messages directly to our e-mail address using a form. To ensure that the visitor was human, I used <b>reCAPTCHA</b> which required me to use the <b>Google reCAPTCHA API</b> to determine the authenticity of the visitor. The e-mail message was constructed in <b>PHP</b> by taking values from the form. The page cannot be hosted (in a working state) on GitHub as PHP code will not be executed by the server hence why only a picture has been shown.</p>

              <h3>Student Survival Guide Website</h3>
              <p>This website was created as a group project in my First Year at University. The website gave students information about the local area - including the locations of hospitals, cinemas etc. and allowed users to post their own recommendations of venues in the form of article pages. My main coding contributions to the site were creating the login system (where users could create an account and log in), creating the article comments system (where logged in users could post about the topic), creating the article like/dislike system, creating the template pages for the articles and website sections, creating the overall website styling and the sourcing/editing of royalty-free images.</p>

              <h3>This Portfolio Page</h3>
              <p>The latest webpage I have developed is the page you are reading right now. All of the code on this page was written entirely by me (aside from the use of the jQuery library for the smooth scrolling links) and all images/videos were also generated by me.</p>
