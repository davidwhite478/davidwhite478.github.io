              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>Hello, my name is David White. I am currently in my third year of study for an MEng in Computer Science at The University Of Manchester. This portfolio page showcases a selection of some of the many projects I have created. This includes many personal projects and a few university assignments I have written.</p>

              <h2>Realtime Image Sharing + Viewing Application</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p> This program allows users to send and receive images with a group over the internet and also view them in real-time together (i.e. when one user changes to an image, all other users will also quickly change to the same image). This allows you to send and discuss images with a group at the same time with all users having the ability to control what image is being shown on screen. This is a <b>personal project</b> I have undertaken to solve a problem that my friends and I often have when trying to discuss images for a project at the same time.
              </p>
              <h3>The video below shows the application being used by two clients - both sending and receiving images and switching between the different images:</h3>

              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>
              The application is written in <b>Java</b> and uses <b>JavaFX</b> for the GUI. To send and receive data between the clients, the application uses the publicly available Eclipse IoT MQTT server (<a href="http://iot.eclipse.org/">iot.eclipse.org</a>) as a third party. This uses the publish/subscribe pattern where all client subscribed to a topic will receive all messages published to that topic. The third-party server is being used to avoid the need for VPNs or other solutions such as port-forwarding - it also means that each client does not need to know the IP address of the other clients in order to send/receive data with them.<br><br>
              As all messages published to this server are public, I have implemented <b>symmetric encryption</b> for all messages (messages are encrypted by the sender and decrypted by all the recipients). Currently, the key is fixed and hard coded into the program which is not very secure as every single message sent by the program can be decrypted using the same key. I plan to remedy this by establishing a new symettric key at the start of every session (and also establish a new key after a certain amount of time has passed). To securely send this key to other users in the session I plan to make the program first generate a public/private key pair. The public key can then be sent to the user who has generated the new symettric key. They can then encrypt the symmetric key (with the other users public key) and send this back to the them.<br><br>
              This project is still <b>in development</b> and as such there are many known issues and bugs with the program which I plan to fix soon.

              <h2>Music Bingo Game Generator</h2>
              <h3>Project Description:</h3>
              <p>Music Bingo is the variation on normal bingo where the numbers are replaced with songs which the players must listen out for. This program allows users to generate their own games of Music Bingo using their own music clips. This is a <b>personal project</b> I wanted to make as there are some interesting problems which need to be solved - including ensuring all tickets are unique, generating PDFs, editing and generating MP3 files, reading and processing ID3 tags and other game issues such as ensuring the game is exciting (by making the win as late as possible), and ensuring only one winner.<br><br>
              Before generating any bingo games the user must first get many song clips (around 10-15 seconds) and label them with the correct ID3 tags (Title and Artist) for that clip. These clips must then be placed in the Clips folder. When the user opens the program, the list on the left will show all the possible songs they have to choose from (with the titles and artists being read from each file's ID3 tags). The user can then select as many songs as they want to be in the game they are generating (a good number is around 45 songs - which typically generates around a 10 minute game). Once the tracks have been chosen, the user must specify the amount of tickets they want to generate in the text entry box in the bottom left of the program and then click the generate game button.<br><br>After a short wait, a folder will open with all the generated files (as shown below). In the folder there is a PDF file of all the bingo tickets that have been generated (example page shown below). There will also be a generated MP3 file which has all the selected tracks edited into a random order with a 'swoosh' sound effect transition between each clip and a 5 second countdown at the start (due to copyright restrictions, an example of a generated MP3 cannot be made available here). To accompany the MP3 there will also be another PDF file which will show the order of when each of the tracks is played on the generated MP3 (example shown below) - this allows whoever is running the game to keep track of the current point in the game.
              </p>

              <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
              <p>This project was written in <b>Python 3</b> and uses <b>Tkinter</b> for the GUI. To ensure that all the bingo tickets are unique, each of the selected songs is assigned a prime number before generating the tickets. When a ticket (of 15 randomly selected songs) is generated, all of the prime numbers associated with the selected tracks are multiplied together and stored in a list of used ticket numbers. If a generated ticket number is already in the list of used tickets, the ticket must be a duplicate (and is therefore discarded) as the only possible way to generate the ticket number by multiplying prime numbers is by using the exact same numbers (and therefore songs).<br><br>
              To generate the MP3 file, the program reads in all the clips with <b>FFMPEG</b> and combines them together (with a transition sound effect between each clip) in the random order generated prior to generating the MP3. Once all the clips have been combined, the new MP3 is exported using <b>FFMPEG</b> and labelled with the correct game ID number.<br><br>
              The python library ‘<b>reportlab</b>’ is used to generate the PDFs of the bingo tickets and track listing.<br><br>
              Along with the PDFs, two text files are also produced. One file simply maps the ticket number to the number generated by multiplying the primes associated with all the tracks on that ticket - this is a simple way of storing all the tracks on a ticket without listing all of them. The other text file lists all the tracks in the game in order of their occurrence in the game along with the prime number associated with that song.
              Both of these files allow a separate <b>ticket checker</b> program I wrote to work. This asks you to input the game number, and ticket number and it will tell you when that ticket will win. This means that the person running the game does not need to check every single song on the ticket in order to check if it has won - therefore potentially saving a lot of time. </p>

                Here is the user interface used for selecting all the songs you wish to be in the game you are generating.

                Here is a page of bingo tickets automatically generated using the software. As you can see, there are three tickets per page with each ticket having the game ID, a unique ticket number and page number in the corner. The ticket numbers on each page are offset by 1/3 of the number of tickets in the generated PDF to ensure that the tickets are in order if all of the pages are cut at the same time (as ticket 2 is behind ticket 1, ticket 3 is behind 2 etc.). The page number is simply to help in the printing process - to keep track of what pages have been printed.
